1) Q When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you have others that collaberate as well, when you work from multiple computers yourself, just to keep a up to date version in the cloud as a backup.

2) Q Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To keep in charge. Testchange. Testchange 2. Testchange 3.

3) Q What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

When you work offline you still have the most recent commits from others.
